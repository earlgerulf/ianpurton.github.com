title: Struts utf 8 and form submissions

Struts will convert data that is received from form submissions to a default encoding because most browsers don't set the content type.

To stop struts mangling the data you need to set the content type with a filter before it gets as far as the struts layer.

Use the filter below

{% highlight bash %}
package filters;

import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.*;

public class UTF8Filter implements Filter
{
  public void destroy() {}

	public void doFilter(ServletRequest request,
		ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
		throws IOException, ServletException
	{
		request.setCharacterEncoding("UTF8");
		chain.doFilter(request, response);
	}

	public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig)
		throws ServletException
	{
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

You'll need to add these settings to your web.xml

{% highlight xml %}
<filter>
  <filter-name>UTF8Filter</filter-name>
	<filter-class>filters.UTF8Filter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
	<filter-name>UTF8Filter</filter-name>
	<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
{% endhighlight %}

Be careful how you view the output of any form submissions, for instance the console on eclipse is not UTF-8 by default.
